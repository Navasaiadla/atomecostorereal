# üéØ Reviews System Guide

This guide covers the complete reviews system implementation for the AtomecoStore e-commerce platform.

## üìã Overview

The reviews system allows customers to:
- ‚úÖ Rate products (1-5 stars)
- ‚úÖ Write review titles and comments
- ‚úÖ See verified purchase badges
- ‚úÖ Edit and delete their own reviews
- ‚úÖ View all reviews for products
- ‚úÖ See average ratings and review counts

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Reviews Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  title TEXT,
  comment TEXT,
  is_verified_purchase BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(product_id, customer_id)
);
```

### Key Features

- **Unique constraint**: One review per customer per product
- **Rating validation**: 1-5 stars only
- **Verified purchases**: Automatic detection based on order history
- **Timestamps**: Automatic creation and update tracking
- **Cascading deletes**: Reviews deleted when product or user is deleted

```

### 2. Verify Setup
